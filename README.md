# SmartBridgeProject  CNN Model to Classify Pollen Grains based on user input
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is Pollen Grain Image Classification Dataset from Kaggle. The classification of pollen species and types is an important task in many areas like forensic palynology, archaeological palynology and melissopalynology. This is the first annotated image dataset for the Brazilian Savannah pollen types that can be used to train and test computer vision based automatic pollen classifiers.

The dataset has a total of 790 pollen grain images (.jpg files) containing 23 classes of pollen grains. The entire file size of the dataset is 32.85 MB with images of around 300x300 resolution. It has a usability of 8.8 and gives a good accuracy with CNNâ€™s.
